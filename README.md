First HTML project for TOP

This project is part of the foundations course from The Odin Project. It is the last part of the HTML lessons to practice and demonstrate that I have a basic knowledge of HTML and how to layout content on a website.

I've built websites in WordPress using Divi, which is a visual WYSIWYG editor. As a result, I have some knowledge of HTML and CSS, but I've never had actual training. I've learned a lot on the fly, but I've never built a site using HTML in this manner.

I'm having a lot of fun working through TOP and I'm excited to begin this recipes website. I'll write more at the end about what I learned, challenges I faced, and anything else that feels appropriate.

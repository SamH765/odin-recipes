                <li>2 packets True Lemon Lemonade approximately ¾ teaspoon</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Preheat the oven to 300℉/150℃ for crisp cookies and 325℉/165℃ for softer cookies. If you want to try both versions, start with on tray of crispy cookies and then increase the oven temp for the second tray.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Lemon Cookie Dough</h4>
            <ol>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">In the bowl of a stand mixer or a large mixing bowl add the room-temperature butter and the sugar. Use the paddle attachment or a hand mixer, start mixing on low speed to combine the butter and sugar. Once they are combined, increase the speed to high and beat until the mixture until the butter and sugar are completely combined. This only takes 1-2 minutes. Scrape the bowl as needed.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Add in the egg and continue to beat the mixture starting on low speed and increasing to high speed for about 4-5 minutes or until the mixture becomes lighter in color and is fluffy.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Add the lemon extract, zest from 1 lemon, and the freshly squeezed lemon juice.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl and stir to combine. Add ⅓ of the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar mixture and mix on low speed until incorporated. Add another ⅓ of the dry ingredients and mix on low until incorporated. Add the final ⅓ of the flour mixture and mix on low just until all of the dry mixture is incorporated.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Baking the Lemon Cooler Cookies</h4>
            <ol>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Scoop out about 1 Tablespoon of the cookie dough to make a 1" ball and place on the cookie sheet or baking tray 3" apart. Do not use parchment if you want crispy cookies.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Bake in the preheated oven on 300℉/150℃ for 20-22 minutes for crispy cookies and bake in a preheated oven on 325℉/165℃ for 15-17 minutes for a softer cookie. The crispy cookies are done when they start to turn a golden color on the edges and a tan color on top. The softer cookies are done when they start to turn a tan color on the edges and remain pale on top.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">Allow the cookies to cool on the baking tray for 2 minutes and then transfer them to the powdered sugar mixture for the first coating. It's important that you don't let them cool all the way before coating in the powdered sugar or the powdered sugar won't stick.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Powdered Sugar Coating</h4>
            <ol>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">While the cookies are baking, combine the powdered sugar and True Lemon Lemonade In a shallow container or plastic bag and mix well.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;">While the cookies are still warm toss them in the powdered sugar mixture to coat both sides and place the cookies on a cooling rack. Allow them to cool completely and then toss again in the powdered sugar mixture.</li>
            </ol>
